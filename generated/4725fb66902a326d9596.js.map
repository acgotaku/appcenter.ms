/**\n   * The RefocusManager provides three major functions:\n   *\n   * 1. Monitors the children of the \"topmost\" registered container to check whether elements\n   * removed from the DOM have focus when they are removed. If so, it attempts to refocus within\n   * the registered container. This is useful in scenarios such as wizards when the \"Next\" button\n   * is removed and changes to a submit button at the end of the process.\n   *\n   * 2. Provides refocus functionality that can be used by other components, such as Autofocus,\n   * that will first check the requested element to focus to determine whether it still exists in\n   * the DOMm and is focusable. If the element is not, it will attempt to refocus within the topmost\n   * registered container.\n   *\n   * 3. Caching the last non-document.body element that received focus (via global-ui-store) so other\n   * components can check that when trying to capture the last focused element. This is useful when\n   * elements (or their parents) are hidden from the DOM before a panel transition, for example.
