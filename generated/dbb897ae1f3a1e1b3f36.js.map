However, using a <Portal> would break that behavior by relocating\n   * DOM elements. So we need our root element to stay in place, un-portaled, so\n   * it can be managed by the ReactCSSTransitionGroup: hence this.refs.container.\n   * So the container gets CSS classes applied to it, and needs to use those\n   * classes to animate its children (the overlay and the actual modal). Ideally\n   * that would look something like this:\n   *\n   * .container.entering, .container.leaving {\n   *   .overlay { background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); } // Fade to transparent\n   *   .modal { transform: translateX(100%); } // Slide in/out\n   * }\n   *\n   * However, that also doesn’t work because of the portal. The overlay and the\n   * modal are no longer actually descendents of the container, which means we\n   * can’t target them with CSS selectors like that. So the solution is to observe\n   * any changes to the container’s class attribute, and then copy them from the\n   * container to the overlay (what happens in `onMutateDOM`). This way, the\n   * ReactCSSTransitionGroup can manage the container however it wants, and any\n   * changes to it get proxied to the new, separate render tree inside the portal.\n   */\n  public componentDidMount() {\n    this.context.refocusManager.registerContainer(this.refs.overlay);\n    this.classObserver.observe(this.refs.container, {\n      attributes: true,\n      attributeFilter: [\"class\"],\n    });\n    this.context.keyboardEventManager.addEscapeListener(this.onRequestClose);\n    loadingStore.setModal(true);\n    // Try to make things a little better for Edge, prevent it from start at document root if focused element is lost\n    globalUIStore.setModalOpen(true);\n  }\n\n  public componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.classObserver.disconnect();\n    this.context.keyboardEventManager.removeEscapeListener(this.onRequestClose);\n    this.context.refocusManager.unregisterContainer(this.refs.overlay);\n    globalUIStore.setModalOpen(false);\n    loadingStore.setModal(false);\n  }\n\n  private onTransitionEnd = (event: React.TransitionEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {\n    this.modalEvents.didTransition.emit();\n    this.modalEvents.pendingEntranceEvent = false;\n  };\n\n  public render() {\n    const { onRequestClose, children, isTop, willTransitionIn, ...props } = this.props;\n    const modalProps = {\n      inert: globalUIStore.isOverlayOpen ?
